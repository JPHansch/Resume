    <p>Hello and welcome! I'm Jeffrey Hanschmann, a Fellow of the <a href="https://www.casact.org/">Casualty Actuarial Society</a> and a Member of the<a href="https://www.actuary.org/homepage">
        American Academy of Actuaries</a>. For the past ten years, I have been growing 
        my career in business and analytics as it pertains to the insurance industry 
        and actuarial insights.  I currently work for <a href="https://www.guycarp.com/">Guy Carpenter</a> as a reinsurance actuary 
        in Seattle, WA, USA.  For more information on my insurance and actuarial background, visit
        my <a href="./cv.html">Professional Experience</a> page or LinkedIn page using the link below.
    </p>
    <p>I would describe myself as process-oriented and goal-focused, with experience
        spanning several business units within insurance companies and spanning several countries, from North America
        to EMEA to Asia Pacific.  My main interest lies at the intersection of insurance solutions, streamline processing, and 
        product development.  That's why I've decided to enhance my skillset and learn web development.  My goal is quite simple:  Make insurance solutions and insights simple and readily available
        for those who want to protect what they truly love.
    </p>

    <p>My hobbies outside of my profession include <a href="https://airbnb.com/h/thelovelyloft">personal real estate investment</a>, personal finance organization and planning, 
        home-cooking and baking, <a href="https://seattlewiffleball.com/">Seattle Wiffleball</a>, tennis, and resource replacement 
        boardgames. 
    </p>

    <p>Please take your time and explore this website. And feel free to get in touch with me.  Thank you!
